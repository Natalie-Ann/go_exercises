// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

/*
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.


Input: slice of ints
Output: int representing index

Explicits: - peak is number that has 2 surrounding numbers that are less than it
						- must be O(log n) - binary search
						- elements outside of array are considered to be lower
Implicits: 	- can early return; any peak counts
						- no repeat numbers next to each other


DS: arrays

Algorithm1:
- Anchor at 0, runner at 1
- Iterate through array
	- runner moves with every iteration
	- if runner number is lower than anchor number and anchor index is 0, return index (early return)
	- else if runner number is higher than anchor number
		- move anchor to right 1
		- if runner is at the end of the array return runner index
	- else if runner number is lower than anchor number
		- check prior anchor number
			- if prior number is lower, return anchor index
			- if prior number is higher, move anchor right 1

Algorithm2:
